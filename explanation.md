# Interval Tree

An interval tree is a data structure that is used for holding a collection of intervals in a way that allows for a fast test of what intervals overlap a point. By extending a binary search tree, this can be done quickly.

#### ADT

The public interface of this interval tree is:

- `add(start, end, name)`
- `remove(name)`
- `clear()`
- `testPoint(point)`: Return a set of all of the intervals that overlap with a given point
- `testRange(start, end)`: Return a set of all the intervals that overlap with a given interval

All intervals in this tree (including the arguments to `testRange`) are endpoint inclusive.

Each node in the tree stores that intervals that it covers, as well as a boundary value if it is not a leaf.

#### Background

For a collection of intervals on the number line, the corresponding elementary intervals are created by breaking it up wherever one interval start or ends. An example of this is shown below.

Each node in the interval tree represents an interval. Non-leaf nodes also contain a boundary value. The nodes are arranged as a binary search tree with the boundaries as the keys. In addition to these two things, each node also stores the subinterval that it represents.

Given a node that represents the interval [*x*, *z*]â€‹ and has the boundary value *y*, then the left child of that node represents the interval [*x*, *y*] and the right child represents [*y*, *z*].

When an interval is stored in a tree, it is placed in the highest node which represents that interval. If necessary, an interval can be broken down and stretched across multiple nodes.

For example, to insert an interval named `a` covering [5, 10] to the above tree, the name `a` is just added to the yellow leaf node.

If you wanted to insert the interval `b` covering [5, 15] into this tree, the interval needs to be split up into [5, 10] and [10, 15]. This means that `b` is added to both the yellow and green leaf nodes.

An interesting note about this way of implementing an interval tree is that it can hold intervals with endpoints at infinity. To store the interval `c` covering (-&infin;, 10], you could split the interval up into (-&infin;, 5] and [5, 10], but the better solution is to store the interval in the node labelled 5, since this node represents exactly the interval that is being added. This same logic applies to nodes without infinite endpoints. If a node has the same interval in both of its children, that interval can more efficiently be placed in the parent node.

#### Implementation

The interval tree class is very simple. It just delegates function calls to the root node.

````python
class IntervalTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self._root = IntervalNode()

    def add(self, start, end, name):
        if not (start < end):
            raise ValueError("The start of an interval must be smaller than its end")
        self._root.add(start, end, name)
        self._root = self._root.rebalance()

    def remove(self, name):
        self._root.remove(name)
        self._root = self._root.rebalance()

    def testPoint(self, point):
        return self._root.testPoint(point)

    def testRange(self, start, end):
        return self._root.testRange(start, end)

    def __repr__(self):
        return repr(self._root)
````



There are some basic methods that the node class has. The node stores its intervals in a set to avoid duplicates and to make node manipulations easier.

If the node has a boundary, that means it's not a leaf. Leaves have both of their children set to `None` while non-leaf nodes have other nodes for both children.

`self.min` and `self.max` store the boundaries of the subinterval that the particular node represents.

````python
class IntervalNode:
    def __init__(self, boundary = None, intervals = (), min = ninf, max = inf):
        self.boundary = boundary
        self.intervals = set(intervals)
        self.left = IntervalNode(min = min, max = boundary) if boundary is not None else None
        self.right = IntervalNode(min = boundary, max = max) if boundary is not None else None
        self.min = min
        self.max = max
        self.height = 0
````

There is also a function to nicely print out the tree.

````python
    def _nicerepr(self, n = 1):
        ret = (('B : ' + repr(self.boundary)) if not self._isleaf else "L") + ' : ' + repr(list(self.intervals))
        if self.left is not None:
            ret += '\n' + '  ' * n + '< ' + self.left._nicerepr(n + 1)
        if self.right is not None:
            ret += '\n' + '  ' * n + '> ' + self.right._nicerepr(n + 1)
        return ret

    def __repr__(self):
        return self._nicerepr()
````
The next block contains methods used for balancing the tree using the AVL algorithm as shown in the textbook. Rotations are covered a bit later on.

````python
    def _updateheight(self):
        if self._isleaf:
            return 0
        lheight = -1 if self.left._isleaf else self.left.height
        rheight = -1 if self.right._isleaf else self.right.height
        return 1 + max(lheight, rheight)

    def rebalance(self):
        bal = self._balance
        if bal == -2:
            if self.left._balance > 0:
                self.left = self.left._rotateleft()
            newroot = self._rotateright()
        elif bal == 2:
            if self.right._balance < 0:
                self.right = self.right._rotateright()
            newroot = self._rotateleft()
        else:
            return self

        newroot.left.height = newroot.left._updateheight()
        newroot.left.height = newroot.right._updateheight()
        newroot.height = newroot._updateheight()

        return newroot
    
    @property
    def _balance(self):
        rheight = self.right.height if self.right else 0
        lheight = self.left.height if self.left else 0
        return rheight - lheight
````
The following methods are self explanatory.

````python
    @property
    def _isleaf(self):
        return self.boundary == None
    
    @property
    def _isemptynode(self):
        return len(self.intervals) == 0
````



Rotation is a bit more complicated in this tree than in a normal binary search tree. As shown below, after a rotation the old root and new root now represent different subintervals. This means that those two nodes need to be updated. The intervals stored in those nodes then need to be moved so they are stay in the correct node.

##### Adding Nodes

When an instance of the interval tree is created, it initially only has a leaf node. This means that new nodes need to be added to represent the endpoints. Adding nodes is a recursive process with many different cases. For this section, assume the interval being added is named `a` and covers [*start*, *end*].

First of all, if the interval to be added is equal to the interval represented by the current node, then the interval can be added to that node's set.

After this, the cases can be split up into those that apply at leaf nodes and those that apply at non-leaf nodes.

###### Current Node is a Leaf

Note that when converting a leaf node to a non-leaf node, you need to make sure that both children are created.

1. **The current node's interval contains both *start* and *end*:** In this case, the current node is given the boundary value *start*. Its right child is a node with boundary value of *end*. Recursively call the add method on this newly created right child. This ends up adding `a` to the node highlighted below.

   ![Leaf Node Case 1](img/addleaf1.svg)

2. **The current node's interval contains *start* but *end* is either outside or on the edge:** In this case, the current node is given the boundary value *start*. The right child of the current node becomes a leaf containing `a`.

   ![Leaf Node Case 2](img/addleaf2.svg)

3. **The current node's interval contains *end* but *start* is either outside or on the edge:** In this case, the current node is given the boundary value *start*. The left child of the currently node becomes a leaf containing `a`.

   ![Leaf Node Case 3](img/addleaf3.svg)

###### Current Node is not a Leaf

Both 1 and 2 are checked:

1. If the end is less than or equal to the boundary, recursively call the add method on the left child. Otherwise, recursively call the add method on the right child.
